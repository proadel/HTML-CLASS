        // HTML Elements
        //------------------------------------------------------------------------
          An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It 
          represents semantics, or meaning. For example, the title element 
          represents the title of the document.

          Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an 
          end tag (or closing tag), with content in between. Elements can also 
          contain attributes that defines its additional properties.
          ========================================================================
             Note: All elements don't require the end tag or closing tag to be 
             present. These are referred as empty elements, self-closing elements 
             or void elements.
          ========================================================================   
          HTML Tags Vs Elements --------------------------------------------------
          ----------------------==================================================
          Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its 
          attributes, an end tag and everything in between. On the other hand an 
          HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of 
          an element, as you can see in the above illustration.

          However, in common usage the terms HTML element and HTML tag are 
          interchangeable i.e. a tag is an element is a tag. For simplicity's sake 
          of this website, the terms "tag" and "element" are used to mean the same 
          thing — as it will define something on your web page.
          -----------------------------------------------
          Case Insensitivity in HTML Tags and Attributes
          -----------------------------------------------
          In HTML, tag and attribute names are not case-sensitive (but most 
          attribute values are case-sensitive). It means the tag <P>, and the tag 
          <p> defines the same thing in HTML which is a paragraph.
          
          But in XHTML they are case-sensitive and the tag <P> is different from 
            the tag <p>.

          Tip: recommended using lowercase for tag and attributing names in HTML, 
          since by doing this you can make your document more compliant for future 
          upgrades.
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Empty HTML Elements (also called self-closing or void elements) are not 
          ------------------- container tags — that means, you can not write 
          <hr>some content</hr> or <br>some content</br>. A typical example of an 
          empty element, is the <br> element, which represents a line break. Some 
          other common empty elements are <img>, <input>, <link>, <meta>, <hr>, 
          etc. 
           ***********************************************************************
           NOTE::: In HTML, a self-closing element is written simply as <br>. 
           In XHTML, a self-closing element requires a space and a trailing slash, 
           such as <br />.
           ***********************************************************************
           Nesting HTML Elements
           ---------------------
           Most HTML elements can contain any number of further elements (except 
           empty elements), which are, in turn, made up of tags, attributes, and 
           content or other elements.

           Tip: Placing one element inside another is called nesting. A nested 
           element, also called a child element, can be a parent element too if 
           other elements are nested within it.

           HTML tags should be nested in correct order. They must be closed in 
           the inverse order of how they are defined, that means the last tag 
           opened must be closed first.
           ------------------------
           Writing Comments in HTML
           ------------------------
           Comments are usually added with the purpose of making the source code 
           easier to understand. It may help other developer (or you in the future 
           when you edit the source code) to understand what you were trying to do 
           with the HTML. Comments are not displayed in the browser. You can also 
           comment out part of your HTML code for debugging purpose.
           ========================================================================
           HTML Elements Types ----------------------------------------------------
           ========================================================================
                Elements can be placed in two distinct groups: block level and 
                inline level elements. The former make up the document's structure, 
                while the latter dress up the contents of a block.

                Also, a block element occupies 100% of the available width and it 
                is rendered with a line break before and after. Whereas, an inline 
                element will take up only as much space as it needs.

                The most commonly used block-level elements are <div>, <p>, <h1> 
                  through <h6>, <form>, <ol>, <ul>, <li>, and so on. Whereas, the 
                    commonly used inline-level elements are <img>, <a>, <span>, 
                      <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <code>, <input>, <button>, etc.

                You will learn about these elements in detail in upcoming chapters.

                Note: The block-level elements should not be placed within 
                inline-level elements. For example, the <p> element should not be 
                placed inside the <b> element.
                  The HTML elements that can be used inside the <head> element are: 
            <title>, <base>, <link>, <style>, <meta>, <script> and the 
            <noscript> element.  
                        
          An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
          The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

           <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
            Examples of some HTML elements:
              <h1>My First Heading</h1>
              <p>My first paragraph.</p>
              ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). 
              These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have 
              an end tag!
              ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              - bloch elements : between each element and the other element new line.
              = 
              = 
              =
              -------------------------------------------------------
              - inline elements : = = =  (in same line..............)
              -------------------------------------------------------
